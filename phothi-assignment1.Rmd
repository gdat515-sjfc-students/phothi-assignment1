# Bad Example: Sky News - Average UK life expectancy

This is an example from Sky News which depicts average UK life expectancy. This is a bad example due to the fact that the height of the bars showing life expectancy are not proportionate to the actual data which they are showing. Doing this is nonsensical and can be misleading the audience into thinking differences are much larger than they actually are.

# Good Example: Interactive U.S. 2016 Budget

This data visualization is of 2016 US Federal budget. It represents where American tax dollars would go and shows what portion of the Federal budget is dedicated to different program areas. This visualization is a good one becuase it is very clear and simple, making it easy to understand and interpret. Different programs are sectioned off, and different areas within specific programs are also further sectioned off representing the size of the budget being allocated for those spcific areas. Furthermore, each program is colored using varying shades of a specific color, darker shades indicating greater spending on those areas, and lighter indicating less spending. The interactive parts of the visualization may also be used in order to see total spending on each area, and to learn more information on each section.
